# 📈 Batting Analytics

Batting metrics computed:

- Total Runs  
- Balls Faced  
- Batting Average  
- Strike Rate  
- Fours  
- Sixes  
- Half Centuries  
- Centuries  

### 🏏 Top Run Scorers

| Rank | Player | Runs |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Virat Kohli | 14,675 |
| 2 | Kumar Sangakkara | 11,640 |
| 3 | Rohit Sharma | 11,357 |
| 4 | MS Dhoni | 10,274 |
| 5 | AB de Villiers | 9,435 |

Virat Kohli dominates ODI batting with exceptional consistency and strike rate.

# 📉 Bowling Analytics

Bowling performance metrics:

- Wickets Taken  
- Runs Conceded  
- Economy Rate  
- Bowling Average  
- Bowling Strike Rate  

### 🎯 Top Wicket Takers

| Rank | Player | Wickets |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Lasith Malinga | 343 |
| 2 | Brett Lee | 281 |
| 3 | Shakib Al Hasan | 279 |
| 4 | James Anderson | 268 |
| 5 | Shahid Afridi | 259 |

Lasith Malinga leads the bowling charts due to his dominance in **death overs**.

---

# 📊 Advanced Analytics

## All-Rounder Impact Score

To evaluate all-rounders fairly, a custom **Impact Score** was developed.

Formula:


Batting Impact = (Player Runs / Max Runs) × 50
Bowling Impact = (Player Wickets / Max Wickets) × 50

All-Rounder Score = Batting Impact + Bowling Impact


### Top All-Rounders

| Rank | Player | Impact Score |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Shakib Al Hasan | 70.29 |
| 2 | Tillakaratne Dilshan | 58.95 |
| 3 | Mohammad Hafeez | 54.60 |
| 4 | Shahid Afridi | 53.78 |
| 5 | Shane Watson | 53.52 |

# 🧤 Wicketkeeper Analysis

Wicketkeepers were evaluated based on:

- Batting performance  
- Catches  
- Stumpings  
- Total dismissals  

### Top Wicketkeepers

| Player | Total Dismissals |
|------|------|
| MS Dhoni | 426 |
| Kumar Sangakkara | 399 |
| Quinton de Kock | 225 |
| Adam Gilchrist | 205 |

MS Dhoni leads the charts with the highest number of stumpings.
